Bloc Jams v2

This was my first app created. The goal was to make someothing that looked like it has the spotify functionality

*Users can play songs from a list
*Users can use the play bar to search, pause or stop a song.
*Different albums have different songs that a person can play (WIP)

This app was first made using Vanilla JS and then it was refactored to use jQuery.
